We are currently working on spt_strip.ipynb 
for the strip testing algorithm and it is use normal process with 
methods from 'Autotransformer' class not to use 'Strip' class.


taken the requeired values for strip lamination 
so that we get cross sectional area above 8.5 mmsq

for given input paramater both the primary and secondary strip 
laminations are same

now we need stack, tongue, ww, wl

** Issues **
=>  given our paramater the area product requried for our 
    calculations is quite large

=>  Given  strip fuction is done when applied for any 
    parmeter of stack, tongue, ww, wl the function is returning none
    Instead of a dictionary.
